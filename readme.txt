== Description ==
What is the email obfuscation about? The idea behind email obfuscation is simple. You want to make it as hard as possible for website crawlers to capture your email address and use it later on.

This plugin remove the email from the \"public\" source code, but your visitors can still click on it to send an email to the address.

You have nothing to do, just install the plugin and all the emails will be hidden to spammers.
